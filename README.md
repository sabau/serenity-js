Serenity/JS is a node.js library designed to make acceptance and regression testing of modern web applications
faster, more collaborative and easier to scale.

**Serenity/JS is a next generation acceptance testing library, expanding the capabilities of 
[Angular Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) to give you:**
* **the flexibility and expressiveness of the [Screenplay Pattern](http://serenity-js.org/design/screenplay-pattern.html)**,  
  _so that your test scenarios stay free of noise and focused on the business logic_,
* **the power and visibility of [Serenity BDD](http://serenity-bdd.info/#/documentation)
[narrative reports](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_detailed_description_of_aggregation_reports)**,  
  _so that failure analysis and release readiness assessment become more efficient_,
* **an easy way to introduce and follow [SOLID design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_&#40;object-oriented_design&#41;)**,  
  _to keep your code simple, reusable and easy to extend_,
* **effortless integration with popular test automation tools like [Cucumber](http://serenity-js.org/cucumber/readme.html), [Mocha](http://serenity-js.org/mocha/readme.html) and Chai**,  
  _so that you can introduce it into your existing toolchain **today**,  
  with just a single, [one-line code change](http://serenity-js.org/overview/retrofitting.html)_!

Although Serenity/JS provides strong support for automating web tests using Protractor and Webdriver,
it works very effectively for non-web tests too! Those include tests that exercise web services or even call application code directly.
